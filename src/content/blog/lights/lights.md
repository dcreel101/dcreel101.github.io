Hi Neighbors, here is how I installed our ceiling lamps.

A strip of cardboard rolled around the cable works pretty well for keeping the cable between the beams. You can also tie a knot in the cable and push it in there.

If you have the sealed version, like in our bedroom, you need another solution of course.
