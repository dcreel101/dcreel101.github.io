### Wow, look at this! I'm finally here!
I've been wanting to build a website for myself for a super long time, and thanks to <MDLink href="https://pages.github.com/" caption="Github Pages"/>,
 <MDLink href="https://astro.build/" caption="Astro"/>,
 <MDLink href="https://daisyui.com/" caption="daisyUI"/>,
 <MDLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/" caption="tailwindcss"/>,
 and <MDLink href="https://astrofy-template.netlify.app/" caption="Astrofy Template"/>, it's finally up and running.

If you know me, you know I have a well-rounded developer skillset, but that also means I eventually get out of date in some areas if I focus more on others.
 This was a nice opportunity for me to refresh myself a little on web technologies during some downtime.
I had to add a lot of features and customizations on top of the basic Astrofy Template, so I really learned a lot about how all of the above mentioned tools work.
