### Wow, look at this! I'm finally here!
I've been wanting to build a website for myself for a super long time, and thanks to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro</a>, <a href="https://daisyui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daisyUI</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tailwindcss</a>, and <a href="https://astrofy-template.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astrofy Template</a>, it's finally up and running.

If you know me, you know I have a well-rounded developer skillset, but that also means I eventually get out of date in some areas if I focus more on others. This was a nice opportunity for me to refresh myself a little on web technologies during some downtime.
I had to add a lot of features and customizations on top of the basic Astrofy Template, so I really learned a lot about how all of the above mentioned tools work.
