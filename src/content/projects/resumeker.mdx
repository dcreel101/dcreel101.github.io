Resumeker is a tool for generating your own CV using data from a local
database and T4 text templates. This allows you to manage your CV data
separately from the formatting. For example, you could use the same data
to generate <Latex />, HTML, or JSON. If you change the data (get a new
job, etc.) you can just regenerate the output without dealing with
formatting. It also supports localization of individual data points as
well as outputting different levels of detail. Example: a summary résumé
in English and a detailed CV in German can be generated from the same
dataset.

I see a lot of possiblities for industrious users, such as automating
form completion online at those pesky duplicate-your-cv-while-applying
websites. Currently, I've just used it to generate my own CV in <Latex/>->pdf. When I've made it a little more user-friendly, I'll make it
public.

## Features
  * A local relational database containing data for generating a CV
  * T4 text templating to generate output (<Latex />, HTML, Json, etc)
  * Selectable/configurable levels of detail and visibility in the output for individual data items
  * Localization possible for all data items individually

## Idea
After becoming unemployed on short notice (be sure to push for timely
contract renewals, everyone), I had to update my CV in English and
German, and potentially translate it to more languages. I also needed to
trim down my very lengthy CV for certain job applications, but I wanted
to keep the full details available for others. At the same time,
everyone was telling me to just let AI rewrite and translate my CV, but
the results were pretty pathetic to be honest. It could handle
individual sections fairly well, but given a whole document it was doing
crazy things like embellishing my skillset and experience to make it
more "attractive". I realize that says something about the AI's training
data, but I personally refuse to do that.

Realizing I had at least 4 formats of the same core data I would need to
manage, I decided to build a tool to manage the data itself instead of
the resulting documents. It also would give me a way to export my data
into formats that could be more easily handled by AI for summarization
and localization, like JSON and CSV.

## Data Storage
The data is stored in a local SQLite database. The design has a high
degree of normalization, which makes it easy to support localization in
an arbitrary number of languages at runtime. Currently, only a single
user's CV exists in the database, but it would be trivial to add support
for multiple users, such as for a cloud service or self-hosted service.

## Software
The software is at a proof-of-concept stage, which basically means it's
a .NET console application running some queries and pushing the results
to a T4 template engine. It does already support selecting different
levels of detail, different languages, and running the output through
different template files. It's missing GUIs for both data entry as well
as selecting/configuring the output options. I currently use a SQLite
browser for data entry, which really isn't ideal.

## <Latex />
Since I didn't attend university, I missed the whole "<Latex /> is the best
thing ever for any kind of document!" craze. This will probably be an unpopular
opinion, but I really found working with <Latex /> to be a disaster for anything
except extremely simple use cases. Everything else is a heap of "it doesn't
support that natively, so add a ton of external code to make it work" and
"oh that doesn't work since 2011" and "but this doesn't work when used with
that" kind of things. It's extremely frustrating, but probably less so if
you use it daily and keep up to date on its quirks. I would say that the
majority of my effort was spent just trying to get my <Latex /> template
to work properly - meaning, align the text and bullet points properly across
pages, and heck, even paginate properly. Overall opinion? Good luck. I'd
just about rather automate creating MS Office documents.

## TODO
  * Minor improvements discovered along the way to a usable output CV
  * GUI for selecting and configuring output options
  * GUI for data entry
  * Prepare example T4 output templates for the public
  * Open-source it
  * Offer a cloud service
