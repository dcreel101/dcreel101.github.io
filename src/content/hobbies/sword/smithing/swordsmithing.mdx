I was gifted a full course in making a Japanese sword at <MDLink href="https://ferrum-d.com/" caption="Ferrum D Gentile"/>, where Mr. Gentile taught me about smithing and working with a forge, hammer, anvil, and press.

Unfortunately, this project is still not finished, due to my limited availability to visit the forge on site. I would still love to finish it off one day - basically the blade is nearly finished, so it's mostly the scabbard and mountings that need to be done.
