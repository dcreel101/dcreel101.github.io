When I worked at Digitec Galaxus, I was a founding member of the Spectre team -
the undisputed coolest team in the company. We were so cool that we decided to
have our own signet (seal) rings made with the team logo and our initials, along
with some individual customizations. I did the 3D designs and sent them off for
lost-wax casting in sterling silver. They can be used to seal things with wax,
although it isn't easy. I should have used more draft on the seal extrusion; I
didn't realize that after production there would even be a slight undercut to
it.
