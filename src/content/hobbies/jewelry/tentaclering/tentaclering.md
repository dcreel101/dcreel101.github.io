This is a ring in the shape of a tentacle that I cast in pure silver using a lost-plastic technique.

I designed the ring in Blender and 3D printed it in PLA on my old printer. Then I attached sprues and set it in
        plaster of Paris. Then I carefully baked that upside down in the oven until all the plastic had a chance to drip
        out. I did it at a low temperature to prevent scorching the plastic and leaving residue behind. Later, I melted
        some pure silver in a ceramic kiln and poured it into the pre-heated mold. Nothing exploded, and it basically
        came out ok. I cleaned it up and smoothed the surface a bit, and that was that. It could have come out better,
        but the recipient was happy with it in this condition.
