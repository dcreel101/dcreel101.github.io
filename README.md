### Site config

You can change global site configuration on '/src/config.ts' file:

- **SITE_TITLE**: Default pages title.
- **SITE_DESCRIPTION**: Default pages title.
- **GENERATE_SLUG_FROM_TITLE**: By default Astrofy will generate the blog slug pages base on the article name. Set this var to false if you want to use the Astro file base (Compatible with Astrofy older versions).
- **TRANSITION_API**: Enable and disable transition API

#### Static pages

The other pages included in the template are static pages. The `index` page belongs to the root page. You can add your pages directly in the `/pages` folder and then add a link to those pages in the `sidebar` component.

Feel free to modify the content included in the pages that the template contains or add the ones you need.

### Theming

To change the template theme change the `data-theme` attribute of the `<html>` tag in `BaseLayout.astro` file.

You can choose among 30 themes available or create your custom theme. See themes available [here](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).

## Sitemap

The Sitemap is generated automatically when you build your website in the root of the domain. Please update the `robots.txt` file in the public folder with your site name URL for the Sitemap.

## Deploy

You can deploy your site on your favourite static hosting service such as Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.

The configuration for the deployment varies depending on the platform where you are going to do it. See the [official Astro information](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) to deploy your website.

> **⚠️ CAUTION** </br>
> The Blog pagination of this template is implemented using dynamic route parameters in its filename and for now this format is incompatible with SSR deploy configs, so please use the default static deploy options for your deployments.
